#Can you come up with Data models and corresponding SQL querying the data model?

The simple data model can be created with following entities
	Customers
	Products
	Orders
	Order Items

Data Model:

Customers Table

customer_id (Primary Key)
first_name
last_name
email
date_of_birth
address




Products Table

product_id (Primary Key)
product_name
price
category
description




Orders Table

order_id (Primary Key)
customer_id (Foreign Key to Customers)
order_date
total_amount




Order Items Table

order_item_id (Primary Key)
order_id (Foreign Key to Orders)
product_id (Foreign Key to Products)
quantity
item_total



#the corresponding SQL queries to perform common operations are given as follows 
#Assuming we have insert the data values in each tables. 


#customer info
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_id = 1;

#product info
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE product_id = 1;

#product categories 
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM Products;


#to get orders for a customer 
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE customer_id = 1;

#to get total spend by a customer

SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM Orders
WHERE customer_id = 1
GROUP BY customer_id;


#to get order details for a customer with products 
SELECT O.*, P.product_name, OI.quantity, OI.item_total
FROM Orders O
JOIN OrderItems OI ON O.order_id = OI.order_id
JOIN Products P ON OI.product_id = P.product_id
WHERE O.customer_id = 1;


#for product recommendation for a customer based on his past orders 
SELECT P.product_id, P.product_name
FROM Products P
WHERE P.category IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT P.category
    FROM Products P
    JOIN OrderItems OI ON P.product_id = OI.product_id
    WHERE OI.order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM Orders WHERE customer_id = 1)
) AND P.product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT OI.product_id
    FROM OrderItems OI
    WHERE OI.order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM Orders WHERE customer_id = 1)
);
